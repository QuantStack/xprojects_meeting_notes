This repository collects the notes for the public developer meetings for the
"x projects" and related C++ scientific computing packages. The main software
packages discussed in the meeting concern the `xtensor` and `xeus` stacks.
Namely:

 - [`xtensor`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor), the C++ tensor algebra
   library,
 - [`xsimd`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xsimd), the C++ SIMD acceleration
   package,
 - [`xeus`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus), the C++ Jupyter kernel protocol
   implementation,
 - [`xwidgets`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xwidgets), the Jupyter interactive
   widgets backend for xeus,

and related projects. Other packages of the scientific computing ecosystem may
be discussed as they relate to the
[`xtensor`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor) and
[`xeus`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus) stacks.
